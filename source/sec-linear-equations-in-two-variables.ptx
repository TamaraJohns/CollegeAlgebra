  <statement>
    <p>
    Linear Equation in Two Variables is the equation of the form:
    <me> Ax+By=C </me>
      
    </p>
    <p>where <m>A,B,C</m> are real numbers. Note that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> cannot be both <m>0</m> simultaneously. Either<m>A</m> can be <m>0</m> or <m>B</m> can be <m>0</m>, but not both at the same.(See what happens if we plug in zeros for both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.)</p>
  <p>A quick reminder: the solution to a linear equation in two variables is an ordered pair that makes the equation true.</p>
  <p>Every linear equation has infinitely many solutions, forming a straight line on a plane. In other words, the graph of any linear equation in two variables is always a straight line.</p>
